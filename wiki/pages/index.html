                associated with the species and strain used for the process.
                Algal strains with a high productivity level are optimal for
                wastewater treatment. However, the disadvantage of using algae
                for wastewater treatment is that not all algae can remove
                wastewater contaminants with the same efficiency. The
                performance of algae as water purifiers depends on the nutrients

                species that can perform efficiently under the given

            Releasing purified water after purification involves the risk of
            leaking genetically modified organisms into the external
            environment. That problem can be resolved enough with existing
            treatment methods, but microalgae are less sensitive than other
            microorganisms. They won't be treated clearly through general
            treatment systems.</span

            Ultraviolet treatment is one of the most general disinfection
            methods. We realized that microalgae are less sensitive to UV
            relatively when we compared the survival ratio of Chlorella vulgaris
            to the coliform survival ratio. We perceived that the existing
            biocontainment system would be vulnerable to microalgae. Thus, to
            ensure biosafety, we have to monitor the leak of genetically edited
            microalgae using a sensitive sensor.</span
