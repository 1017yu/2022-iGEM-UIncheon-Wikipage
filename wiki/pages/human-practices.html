        >It is important not to remain our project in a lab, but to bring it out
        to the real world. We’ve investigated how we can apply our project
        concept to the real wastewater treatment infrastructure. Our project, an
        intrinsic biosensor in algae, was developed with the application of gene
        modification to wastewater treatment in mind. Thus, our human practice
        activities aimed to seek the realization of possibilities of the
        genetically modified wastewater treatment. To identify the current
        situation, we first visited four wastewater treatment offices in
        Incheon: Gwaja, Unbok, Gongchon, and Namhyang. In addition, we had a
        meeting with prof. dr. ir. Di Wu, who is an expert on wastewater
        treatment, for the application of our project.

        We visited Gwaja office and interviewed the assistant manager, Daeseok
        Park. Gwaja office has the biggest scale of infrastructure in Incheon.
        350kt per day of foul water from Seo-gu district flows into the office.
        As the Bupyung-Juan Industrial park is located nearby, we realized that
        its main concern is dealing with unauthorized discharged wastewater.
        Park told us that specific elements of heavy metal in the wastewater are
        very difficult to remove through chemical reagent. In addition, if the
        inflow rate is increased over the acceptance level by the rainfall, for
        instance, they cannot help but release incompletely purified water. In
        case of disqualification of released water, the office has to pay a
        fine, and this occasion has been frequently happening. Indeed, of the
        released water out of 15 days of February 2021, only a single day was
        qualified. There is clearly a need for more effective treatment.

        At Unbok office, manager Jongki Lee guided us through the facilities and
        had an interview. The office has tackled the domestic sewage from the
        residential complex near the airport. During the interview, he
        emphasized the burden of the increasing cost of chemical reagents and
        filters. He said that the price is especially burdensome these days, as
        the raw material becomes expensive. This could be a reason for the
        application of gene modification in wastewater treatment. Gongchon and
        Namhyang offices have treated the same types of wastewater as Unbok
        office. Three offices had similar characteristics.
        <br />
        <br />
        From visits to four wastewater treatment offices, we acknowledged some
        points to improve in wastewater treatment. In all facilities,
        microorganisms are utilized for the degradation of organic matter. This
        process is called activated sludge. It basically functions by
        encouraging the growth of microorganisms, with altering environments for
        dominantly growing different types of microorganisms at each stage. We
        noticed that the distinction among microorganisms is too simple. It has
        been simply distinguished depending on the preferred growth environment,
        such as the aerophile and the anaerobe. We felt a necessity of strain
        selection. If we select specific strains and allow to culture them
        dominantly rather than pre-existing organisms, the performance will be
        improved and that is the starting point of the application of gene
        modification.
        <br />
        <br />
        In terms of strain selection, we investigated applicable methods to this
        idea. Consortia between algae and bacteria were chosen as a good option.
        According to prior research, better growth of both two organisms can be
        expected through signal and nutritional exchange. Especially, microalgae
        is an ideal organism since it efficiently removes nitrogen and
        phosphorus and has a high content of neutral lipids, which is a raw
        material of biofuel. Indeed, we found that visited offices have just
        wasted cellular pellet from the activated sludge, or they simply used it
        as the solid refuse fuel recovered fuel. From the perspective of the net
        cost reduction, recycling the pellet to the bio-material is an
        attractive option. On the other hand, we started to have a doubt about
        why microalgae is not used in the current wastewater treatment system.
        <br />
        <br />
        We had a meeting with prof. dr. ir. Di Wu, whose research field is
        wastewater engineering. During the meeting, he answered our question:
        Why microalgae are not used in Korea? He said that microalgae are not
        suitable organisms for the removal of organic matter, since it is
        autotrophs. He said microalgae is suitable for treating daily wastewater
        rather than domestic and industrial wastewater. In the meeting, we also
        realized that microalgae are inappropriate to apply in Korea since the
        annual difference in the temperature in Korea is large.
        <br />
        <br />
        In fact, the meeting with prof. Di Wu reminded us an interview in the
        wastewater. We briefly introduced our plan. The staff advised us that
        convincing the Ministry of Environment is mandatory, since there is a
        difference of interests between field staff and administrator. According
        to the advice, field staffs even have interest on the secondary benefits
        that is not covered by the standard, such as degradation of
        microplastics. On the other hand, administrators have only interest to
        satisfy the standard of the purification. Everything else not covered
        does not matter to them. In addition, the current policy restricts
        offices to create additive values from recycling. This was why the cell
        pellets were not recycled as valuable. He mentioned that it will take a
        long time to convince administrators for the implementation.
        <br />
        <br />
        Based on the accumulated knowledge from interviews, we started to
        investigate whether gene modification could complement disadvantages of
        microalgae. First, It is identified that some strains living in
        Antarctica synthesize antifreeze protein, which is applicable in Korean
        climate. A prior research also showed heterologous gene introduction of
        mercuric reductase into microalgae, which supports removal of heavy
        metal. In addition, there have been many studies to improve biomass
        yield though gene manipulation. Our concept, consortia, is also a good
        choose to balance the performance between degradation of organic matters
        and removal of nitrogen and phosphorus.

        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        The result of gene manipulation is bound to the regulation of use of
        genetically modified organism. The policy in Korea demands the risk
        assessment to use Living modified organism (LMO). LMO is monitored by
        Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. In case of the wastewater
        treatment, the authority will demand documents before its implement.
        <br />
        The required documents are below:
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="span-sub">
          <span>
            ① Application for permission to install and operate production
            process use facilities (LMO Act Enforcement Regulations, Attachment
            No. 34)<br />
            ② Design drawings or copies of production process use facilities
            <br />③ Documents proving the scope of production process use
            facilities and rights related to their ownership or use <br />④

        <br />
        <br />
        After submission, Healthcare & Safety committee in the agency will
        evaluate and announce the result in 60 days with issuing the permit for
        installation and operation of production process use facilities.
        <br />
        <br />
        In terms of disinfection process, wastewater treatment facilities
        already had some process for biosafety. They have mainly used
        chlorination or UV-radiation to purified water. We studied whether
        current bio-containment system still can be used for microalgae. In
        fact, microalgae has insensitive to chlorination and UV-radiation.
        According to research, while 99% of bacteria in the sludge will be
        killed with less 10kJ/m2 of UV-C radiation for seconds (Roeber, 1975),
        over 10kJ/m2 for minutes is reported to be enough to function for
        microalgae (Pfendler, 2018). In case of chlorination, it is revealed
        that microalgae accelerated to grow while bacteria is inhibited to grow
        at low free chlorine concentration. (Hu, 2020) From prior research, we
        concluded that more secure bio-containment system or sensitive biosensor
        is needed to application of gene manipulation into wastewater treatment
        in the wastewater treatment offices.

        ><br />
        The Incheon city we know thesedays was much different then in late
        1900s. Reclamation project had beed declared cause of the increasing
        population and industrial factories. And one unexpected thing is that
        there was similar reclamation project in early 17s with same reasons.<br />
        From this we can know how long the history of reclamation project had
        been started in Incheon.<br />
        However, Reclamation project and increased population brought some
        problems to the environments. And the problems came back to citizens who
        live there.<br />
        Specially one of the wastewater treatment plants nearby industiral
        focused area had to purifiy wastewaters that contain double amount of
        heavy metals every day. Sadly, the plants can only eliminate half of the
        concentrated heavy metals. This means rest of the heavy metals will be
        exposed to the rivers.<br />
        The plants officals told us that based on the EPA standard,
        microorganism can recover in 0.48 heavy metal concentrations.
        Suprisingly one of the highest income sewage that been dilution with
        living and industrial field recorded was 12epa which is over double of
        the legal wastewater standards.<br />
        Our team have been focusing on how to solve this problems which can be
        more effective, more eco-friendly and reduce the cost for purification
        and upkeep expenses.

        <div style="font-size: 2vw"><b>The solution:</b></div>
        Since government was using chemicals for sedimentation, increasing the
        amount couldn’t be a good solutions. So we searched to find an creature
        that can remove heavy metals and basic COD elimination ability.<br />
        In this case, micro algae was the most acceptable organism to remove N,
        P and heavy metals at the same time. We will use co-culture as an
        advantage for microalgae growth and biocontainment system.<br />Also,
        not just for purification we will grow them on the filter and collect
        them automatically by our developed bioreactor.
        <br />
        <br />
        Highlights<br />- The size of the domestic water market increased 3% for
        5years from 91billion dollars to 106billion dollars. One of the most
        grown markets, infrastructure and process of sewage treatment have shown
        great improvement from 30billion dollars to 38 billion dollars,
        especially the sewage market which tries to raise 5% of the investment
        each year to develop the efficiency of sewage purification.
