        >The iGEM competition is a student-led research competition. We have
        proactively set up the project, collected the fund, and executed the
        experiments. However, this could not be possible without the many
        contributions of experts, advisors, and institutions. Their insight and
        consideration helped us a lot in successfully completing our first
        attempt.

          competition proposal, he gladly accepted our suggestion although our
          belonged universities were different.<br />
          He provided the research advisory on biology, the research
          environment, and financial support. Thanks to his consideration
          ensuring our free discussion on the research concept,<br />
          we could freely put our thoughts into action. We also appreciate his tolerance for
          the resource waste in his lab by our errors. <br />In addition, we
          would like to comment our gratitude to his lab members who gladly
          agreed to share their lab space. The advices from Dr. Lee and MS candidate
          Yun were really helpful to keep the biosafety in the lab.
