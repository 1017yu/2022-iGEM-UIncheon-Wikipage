the work done by each of the student members on your team and any work that was
done by people outside of your team, including the host labs, advisors,

        >The iGEM competition is a student-led research competition. We have
        proactively set the project, collected the fund, and executed the
        experiments. However, this could not be possible without many
        contributions of experts, advisors, and institutions. Their insight and
        consideration helped us a lot in successfully completing our first
        attempt.

          competition proposal, he gladly accepts our suggestion although our
          belonged universities were different.<br />
          He provided the research advisory on biology, the research
          environment, and financial support. Thanks to his consideration
          ensuring our free discussion on the research concept,<br />
          we could do what we really want. We also appreciate his tolerance for
          the resource waste in his lab by our multiple errors. <br />In
          addition, we would like to comment our gratitude on his lab members
          who gladly agreed to share their lab space. Advices of Dr. Lee and MS
          candidate Yun were really helpful to keep the biosafety in the lab.
