        we have collaborated with multiple teams. The collaboration not only
        allowed us to share ideas but also to listen to others.

        We had a meeting with the FSU team. As a beginner, we strongly needed to
        have a chance to listen other teams' experiences. During the meeting, we
        discussed project concepts with each other. We found both projects can
        be complementary to each other. After that, we received some advice for
        the competition and learned some concepts of applicable genetic
        elements.

        We participated in the iGEM’s Den held by the KU Leuven team. At the
        event, we listened to other teams’ project presentations. We also showed
        our project and received experts’ comments. From experts, we were
        advised to build mathematical modeling of our genetic circuit and
        reorganize the explanation for the appropriateness of our project.

        To raise public awareness of synthetic biology in Korea, we have
        prepared a debate competition for both high school students and
        undergraduates. For the success of the competition, we put efforts to
        introduce experts who would give a speech for educating synthetic
        biology to the participants and designed the whole program together.
        Especially, our team took a role in hosting the event. This
        collaboration was especially meaningful since Korean teams prepared an
        event together for the first time.
